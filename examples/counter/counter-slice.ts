/**
 * Counter Slice — demonstrates basic Redux patterns:
 *
 * - `createAction` for defining typed actions (with and without payloads)
 * - `createReducer` with `.with()` case handlers for immutable state updates
 * - Clean initial state type definition
 *
 * This is the simplest possible slice — a good starting point for new features.
