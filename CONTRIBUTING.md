# Contributing to themis

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document covers how to set up the project, run the checks, and submit changes.

## Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Running Tests

Tests are written with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):

```bash
pnpm vitest run
```

## Required Checks

Before opening a pull request, make sure the following pass:

```bash
# Run the test suite
pnpm vitest run

# Validate architecture rules (import boundaries, layering)
node scripts/validate-architecture.mjs

# Validate release readiness (package exports, build artifacts)
node scripts/validate-release.mjs
```

For a logic change, run a small relevant workload against the before and after
versions using the same runtime, inputs, and repetitions. Check correctness
separately and record the timings and any observed noise in the change notes.
Keep the check temporary and scoped to the changed logic, not a benchmark framework.

## Skills

The `skills/` directory contains agent skill files. Pull requests that touch `skills/` are checked by the **Validate Skills** GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml`), which verifies frontmatter, that skill names match their paths, and that files stay under the 500-line limit.

## Architecture

Before making changes, read the guides in [`docs/`](./docs/) — they cover stores, selectors, reducers, sagas, and the public import boundaries that `validate-architecture.mjs` enforces.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. Keep changes focused; follow the existing code style and patterns documented in `docs/`.
3. Add or update tests for any behavior change.
4. Run the required checks listed above.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change.
